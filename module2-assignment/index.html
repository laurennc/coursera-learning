<!-- 
You really want to design for all devices. 

A responsive website is - "a site designed to adapt its layout to the viewing environment by using fluid, proportion-based grids, flexible images, and CSS3 media queries."

Most common responsive layout is a 12-column grid responsive layout. 
	-- 12 because easily divisible. 4 columns of 3, 2 columns of 6 etc etc
	-- 1 column is 8.33% of the webpage
	-- and you can nest 12 column grids insdie of each other
